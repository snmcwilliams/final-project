              Sometimes, it’s better to leave hair styling to the professionals.<br>
              As a circus dog, it is imperative to have the trendiest hair styles.<br>

              Dog Bodies of Water: Reviews by Reggie<br>T
              This is a classic Kentucky creek. Very often spotted on hiking trails, in parks, and occasionally backyards.<br>
              I cannot denounce the Kentucky creek, it gets the job done.<br>
              However, this particular one is a little shallow, and the water moves slower than I prefer.<br>
              I give it two dog paws.

              Ah, my favorite time of the year!<br>
              I love that I get to grow my hair out long and play in the snow.<br>
              I could play in the snow forever, it's just so much fun.<br>

              Rue on the other hand, well she's not a fan.<br>

              she most definitely doesn't like frozen paws.<br>
              You know once I played in the snow so much that I turned into a massive snowball!<br>
              No joke, maybe a slight over exaggeration, but whatever,<br>
              my person carried me in and gave me a warm bath.<br>
              Thankfully I survived but it was scary there for a minute.
